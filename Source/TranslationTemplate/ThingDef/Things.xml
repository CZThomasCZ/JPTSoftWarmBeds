  <!-- EN: The simplest and most practical bed ever invented, made from just some cloth or leather and strings. You can hang it anywhere, even take it with you for a good nap when travelling. Hanging in the air, it keeps you cool, which is perfect for a tropical weather! Not as comfortable as a regular bed, though. -->
